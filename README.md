# Up Down

# Gameplay
Up Down is a simple game for the Pebble. The game will pick a random direction, up or down. You must push the up or down button on the pebble within a certain amount of time or you lose. If you press the wrong button, you'll lose as well. The game gets faster as you progress, and the timer resets to a lower initial time every 50 points.

# Future Plans
* More difficult directions, such as a double up or double down
